add element listener to detect when to resize sidebar!!
    currently it happens on window resize and with expando click
    but seems to be glitching; should look into why / when
    should use element listener so it matches height of wrapper2, so simple
    and then footer should have top to match this

back button on issue navigator should be greyed out when not possible

Indexers demand "back to top" button

Push Log in to the left of scrollbar (noticed on mac)
